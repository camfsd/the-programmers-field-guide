Part 0 has helped us set the stage for the first leg of our journey, in which we will explore **programs as instructions**.
As we saw in [Digital Realities](/book/part-0-getting-started/1-digital-realities/0-overview), programming is about building abstractions.
There are different ways or styles of thinking about abstractions, called **programming paradigms**.

In this guide we will start by focusing on **imperative** programming, in which we view programs as a **sequence of instructions** that tell the computer what to do. Part 1 focuses directly on this perspective. You will learn how each instruction works, when to use them, and how to combine them to create small programs.

Your journey begins with [Sequence and Data](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/0-overview), where we will look at the basic premise of imperative programs: that programs are a sequence of instructions that manipulate data. In [Communicating Syntax](/book/part-1-instructions/2-communicating-syntax/0-overview) we detour to explore how the details of a programming language can be communicated, including the visual notation we will use. The bulk of Part 1 will come in [Control Flow](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/0-overview), which explores ways to achieve dynamic behaviour in the computer.

This part will focus on developing key competencies in:

- **Computational thinking**. By understanding how instructions work, you will start to see ways of using them to design and build digital realities.
- **Algorithms**. You will learn to translate larger tasks into steps the computer can execute.
