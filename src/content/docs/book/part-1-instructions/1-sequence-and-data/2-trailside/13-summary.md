Programming with sequence and data involves two things:

1. Thinking about the values you will need in your program.
2. Thinking about the sequence of steps you will need to get the outcome you want.

You need to think about both of these together. Break down your problems into small discrete steps, each of which gets you a little closer toward your goal.

With each piece of data, think "Does this need to change?" If the answer is yes, then use a variable. If no, use a constant or literal value. At the same time, think "What kind of value is this?" If it is a number, is it a whole number (`int`) or a real number (`double`)? This will help you make the many small decisions you need to make as you craft your code.

An overview of these concepts is shown in the concept map below. The next section will look at how you can use these concepts to design some small programs.

:::note[Summary]

- Building blocks are things that go into building your digital reality. You can create and use these within your code.
- Instructions capture the different *things* you can command the computer to perform.
- Your program is a **sequence** of instructions that use **data** (in variables, constants, and literals) that get the computer to do something when it is run.

In the next chapter we will look into the way we can communicate the syntax of a programming language, before we move on to the coding statements we need to make our programs more dynamic and interactive.
