title: Test Your Knowledge
---

With indirect access you can start to include updates more easily in your programs. Build one or more of the following to explore how you can use pass by reference to update values in your programs structs.

- [Bank System](/book/part-2-organised-code/4-indirect-access/3-explore/3-1-database) - create a program to perform financial transactions.
- [Click game](/book/part-2-organised-code/4-indirect-access/3-explore/3-2-reaction-game) - create a small reaction timer game.

:::caution

Make sure that you are using this activity to demonstrate how to build a program that utilises **pass-by-reference** for parameters that have a custom data type (eg. structs), to allow the struct data declared in main to be updated within the procedure(s).

You should also test out what occurs if you remove the `&`, and demonstrate your understanding of why this occurs.
