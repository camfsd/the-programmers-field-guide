title: Test Your Knowledge
---

At this point in your journey, you have the tools to build more interesting programs by organising your code and your data. To test out your understanding, build one or more of the following programs.

- [Entity manager](/book/part-2-organised-code/3-structuring-data/3-explore/3-1-entity) - create a simple data entry system that allows you to see and edit details of a single record.
- [Explore game states](/book/part-2-organised-code/3-structuring-data/3-explore/3-2-game) - explore creating a game menu and other states.

:::caution

Make sure your code isn't just all done in main, and that you are using this activity to demonstrate how to build a program using custom data types, which should include at least one **struct**, with related **functions** and **procedures**, and one **enum**, with a related switch/case statement.
