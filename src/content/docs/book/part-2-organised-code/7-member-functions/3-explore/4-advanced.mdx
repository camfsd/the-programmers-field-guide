Here are some options of programs you can build:

- [Dynamic Menu](/book/part-2-organised-code/7-member-functions/3-explore/4a-dynamic-menu): use objects to manage the user actions in a terminal application. The same ideas can apply to graphical applications, but here we test these in the terminal.
