Member functions give you the ability to combine functionality and data within your structs/classes, with this giving rise to the term object to help us more easily talk about these entities within our programs.

Now that you have a basic understanding of member functions, let's have a go at putting these together to create some simple entities with both functionality and data.

In this section we will build a simple [account](./1-account) entity to model a bank account. In this, we will step through the mechanics of building this using a class. Following that we will revisit our [dynamic array](/book/part-2-organised-code/6-deep-dive-memory/2a-advanced-tour/02-0-dynamic-array) from the [memory deep dive](/book/part-2-organised-code/6-deep-dive-memory/0-overview) chapter.
