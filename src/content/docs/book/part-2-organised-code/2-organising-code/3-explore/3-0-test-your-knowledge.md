title: Test your knowledge
---

Having explore how we can organise code to help make the code in your programs easier to manage, now you need to test your understanding of what you have seen. Build one or more of these programs to demonstrate how to create and use functions and procedures:

- [AFL game data](/book/part-2-organised-code/2-organising-code/3-explore/3-1-afl-score) - create functions and procedures to calculate AFL scores and game details.
- [Click game](/book/part-2-organised-code/2-organising-code/3-explore/3-2-targets) - create functions and procedures for a small target hitting game.

:::caution

Make sure your code isn't just all done in main, and that you are using this activity to demonstrate how to build a program using **functions** and **procedures**, and how to pass data to functions/procedures using **parameters**.
