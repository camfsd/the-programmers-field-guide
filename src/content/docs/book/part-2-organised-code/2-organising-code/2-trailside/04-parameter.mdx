title: "Function Parameters"
---

Now let's look at an example of a function with parameters.

There are three function declarations in the code below: `square`, `point_in_circle`, and `main`.
Each of these performs a number of steps and returns a value.

- The `square` function accepts a `val` parameter, and returns the square of this. This is achieved with a single line of code, but helps make the other code more readable.
- In `point_in_circle`, we accept parameters for the point (`pt_x` and `pt_y`) and the circle (`c_x`, `c_y`, and `c_radius`) and return a boolean value indicating if the point is within the circle. To achieve this, we can get the distance from the point to the center of the circle using the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem), which we store in a local variable called `distance`, and then compare this with the circle's radius to get the result.
- The `main` function is the entry point, and returns a value that indicates if the program completed successfully or not. Returning 0 at the end indicates the program succeeded. Any other value is treated as an error code.

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

using std::to_string;
using std::sqrt;

double square(double val) 
{
    return val * val;
}

bool point_in_circle(double pt_x, double pt_y, double c_x, double c_y, double c_radius)
{
    double distance = sqrt(square(pt_x - c_x) + square(pt_y - c_y));
    return distance <= c_radius;
}

int main()
{
    write_line("5 squared is " + to_string(square(5)));

    write_line("A point at 1, 3 is in a circle at 0, 0, with radius 4: " + to_string(point_in_circle(1, 3, 0, 0, 4)) );

    return 0;
}
```

:::tip
To get the distance between the point and the center of the circle we are also using the [sqrt](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/numeric/math/sqrt) function from the math standard library.
Don't worry if the maths here doesn't make sense -- it is not the point of the example!
Focus on how the function parameters are used.
:::

Notice we can use the `square` function in the calculation in `point_in_circle`. Once you have a function that calculates something, you can call it any time you need that value.

The great thing about parameters is that they really help you **generalise** what your functions and procedures can do. By accepting a value parameter, the `square` function can be used to square *any* `double` value. Similarly, by accepting parameters for the point and circle, the `point_in_circle` function can work for *any* point in *any* circle.

:::note[Summary]

- Parameter is the **term** given to a [variable](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/2-trailside/07-variable) declared to accept the value from an argument passed to a [function or procedure](/book/part-2-organised-code/2-organising-code/2-trailside/01-0-functions-and-procedures) when it is called.
- The **procedure or function call** must provide argument values for each of the function or procedure's parameters.
- Within the function or procedure, the parameters can be used in the same way as any other
variables.
- It is **good practice** to use parameters to pass values into a function or procedure.
