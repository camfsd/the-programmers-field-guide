In this walkthrough we will build out a program to manage a fictitious cheese shop. This will include managing stock on hand, and tracking sales.

:::tip[Monty Python Reference]

There is a classic Cheese Shop sketch from the Monty Python team. Unfortunately there isn't currently an official video on this. However, you may be able to find reference to this on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cheese+shop+sketch+monty+python) if you search.
