At this stage you should now be ready to start considering building your own programs. Think about something you are interested in creating, and then start to plan out the data and functionality it will require. Share your ideas with others, particularly those with more programming experience. Get their thoughts about how you plan to structure things.

Remember to build things iteratively, and to celebrate your successes.

When you get stuck - talk with others. Building good software is challenging, and talking through designs and programming problems can help you see what needs to be done to get things going again.

In the next section we will start to explore object-oriented programming, which should help build larger and more complex solutions with some additional tools. These will build upon the kinds of things you are exploring and working with now.
