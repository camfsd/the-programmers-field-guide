We have seen a lot in our journey so far -- the different instructions, how they work within the computer, and how we can start to put these together in order to create small programs.

To wrap up this part, we will stop and look in more detail at putting these concepts into action. The goal of this chapter is to bring together what we have seen and build a small program. We will focus on how to approach building a larger program, and introduce more formal testing approaches and tools.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter you should be able to:

- Use procedural programming concepts to underpin the design of a program.
- Apply unit testing tools and basic test driven development ideas.
- Think through and communicate the intended structure of a program.
- Build a program of your own design, using iterative development ideas.
